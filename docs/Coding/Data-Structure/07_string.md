# String

A `string` is traditionally a sequence of charactors, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable. The storage of string can be:

- an array of `char` with the end of `\0`, which is the `C`-style string;
- the stl `string` container, whose length is changable;
- lieral constant(some charactors enclosed by `"`).
