# Linked List

A `linked list` is a data structure in which the objects are arranged in a linear order. Unlike an array, however, in which the linear order is determined by the array indeces, the order in a linked list is determined by a pointer in each object. Linked lists provide a simple, flexible representation for dynamic sets, supporting (though not necessaryily efficiently) all the operations.
