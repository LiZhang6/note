# Orthogonal Matrices and Gram-Schmidt

In this lecture we finish introducing orthogonality. Using an orthonormal basis or a matrix with orthonormal columns makes calculations much easier. The Gram-Schmidt process starts with any basis and producesa an orthonormal basis that spans the same space as the original basis.
