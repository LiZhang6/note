# Properties of Determinants

## Determinants

Now halfway through the course, we leave behind rectangular matrices and focus on square ones. Our next big topics are determinants and eigenvalues.

The `determinant` is a number associated with any square matrix; we'll write it as `det A` or $|A|$. The determinant encodes a lot of information about the matrix; the matrix is invertible exactly when the determinant is non-zero.

## Properties

Rather than start with a big formula, we'll list the properties of the determinant. We already know that $begin{vmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \\ \end{vmatrix} = ad - bc$; these properties will give us a formula for the determinant of square matrices of all sizes.

1. $|I| = 1$
2. If you exchange two ros of a matrix, you reverse the sign of its determinant from positive to negative or from negative to positive.
3. If we multiply one row of a matrix by $t$, the determinant is multiplied by $t$:
